# pde-variational-method

This repository contains codes for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) manually, by writing the linear system derived from the variational formula without relying on any external libraries. 

## Contents

- **3.mesh_refinement.py**: This file contains the implementation of a method to solve a Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions using a finite element approach. It includes functions to construct the global stiffness matrix and load vector, perform mesh refinement, and solve the linear system derived from the variational formulation.

## Purpose

These codes were developed for personal practice to understand the variational method, the construction of the matrices that make up the linear system, and how techniques like L2 norm and mesh refinement work. 

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own learning and experimentation with PDEs and finite element methods.
